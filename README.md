# masonry-gallery

Exercise:

In this exercise you will build a complex masonry grid using CSS Grid Layout. The CSS Grid has changed the way we design our layouts and youâ€™re going to build a fun project using its features. You will take this example grid below and turn it into a "masonry gallery".

Things to Keep in Mind Before We Start Building the Grid

Calculate the smallest grid cell that you want to have in your grid, i.e. the smallest image you want to have in your grid.
A cell is determined by the number of rows (height) and the number of columns (width) it spans.
The smallest cell size will determine how complex your grid will be.
Calculate the number of columns and rows based on the smallest cell.
You can use either the grid-row / grid-column method or grid-template-areas - the choice is yours.
